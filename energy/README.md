# Practicing Data Analysis and Forecasting with Energy Data
Creating features, visualizations, and different forecasts with ARIMA and SARIMA 

# General Info 
This is my first project utilizing data science and forecasting tools applied to a subject area I'm very interested in tackling: energy demand and supply. Here I have a PJM data set from Kaggle. I keep my process and mistakes/bad forecasts in the file to show my journey to an actually decent forecast. 

# To Do 
* I want to generate accuracy metrics for the last forecast generated
* Use a linear regression + XGBoost hybrid model to forecast 

# Technologies
Project is created with: 
* Jupyter Notebooks
* Python
